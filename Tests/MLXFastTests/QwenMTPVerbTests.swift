// Unit-level guards for the Qwen 3.6 native-MTP verbs. NOTHING here loads a
// model, opens a worker or touches a network: every assertion reads checked-in
// text, runs pure arithmetic, or feeds a synthetic report through the same code
// a real one goes through.
//
// The three classes of bug these exist for, in the order they have actually
// happened on this repo's other speculative track:
//
//   1. A GATE THAT ASSERTS A FIELD THE PAYLOAD DOES NOT EMIT. `jq -e` then fails
//      on every run and the gate is dead before it ever gates anything. The
//      DFlash parity gate shipped that way (it required `.experimental` and
//      `.target_verification_mode`); the general form of the check is what would
//      have caught it, so it is applied here from day one.
//   2. A LEDGER THAT CLOSES BY ARITHMETIC RATHER THAN BY AUDIT. The retired MTP
//      track validated `2*pairs - rollbacks + serialRows == totalTokenCount`,
//      which a worker that verified nothing passes.
//   3. A FLAG OR FIELD RENAMED ON ONE SIDE OF A TWO-CONSUMER CONTRACT.
