// Merge-at-load for the SEPARATELY PINNED Qwen 3.6 MTP head.
//
// THE DELTA FROM THE VALIDATED DRIVER, STATED PLAINLY. The MTP session's driver
// loaded a MERGED checkpoint: a directory produced by `merge-mtp-head.sh`, which
// hardlinks the backbone shards, writes the head's tensors into a new shard under
// an `mtp.` prefix, registers them in the index, and rewrites `config.json` to
// declare `model_type: qwen3_6_mtp` with `mtp_num_hidden_layers: 1`. The ranked
// track does NOT do that: the operator's Q8 decision is SEPARATE TREES, both
// upstream-revision-pinned and both byte-verified against their own manifests
// before anything loads. So the merge happens at load time, in memory, here.
//
// What has to be equivalent, and how each half is checked:
//
//  1. TENSOR NAMES. The published head (mlx-community/Qwen3.6-27B-MTP-4bit) uses
//     BARE names — `fc.*`, `norm.weight`, `pre_fc_norm_embedding.weight`,
//     `pre_fc_norm_hidden.weight`, `layers.0.*`. The merge script prefixes every
//     one with `mtp.`; `_additionalWeightSources` does exactly the same thing,
//     with the same prefix, before `sanitize` and before the quantization walk.
//     `expectedHeadTensorCount` pins the count the pinned revision carries, so a
//     head tree that lost or gained a tensor is a load-time failure rather than a
//     model that silently drafts from a partly-uninitialized head.
//
//  2. QUANTIZATION WIRING. `quantize(model:)` decides which submodules become
//     quantized layers by asking whether `weights["<path>.scales"]` exists. The
//     merge therefore has to land BEFORE that walk, which is why the vendored
//     hook sits where it does and not in a post-load `update(parameters:)`.
//
//  3. CONFIG SEMANTICS. The merge script sets `model_type: qwen3_6_mtp` and
//     `mtp_num_hidden_layers: 1`. Neither rewrite is needed here and NEITHER IS
//     SKIPPED SILENTLY: the pinned backbone's own `text_config` already carries
//     `mtp_num_hidden_layers: 1` (it is the same architecture family; the
//     backbone revision simply ships no `mtp.*` TENSORS), and the transform
//     copies `text_config` verbatim into the runtime `config.json` — so the
//     loaded configuration's `mtpNumHiddenLayers` is 1 either way, and
//     `Qwen35TextModel.init` attaches the head on `mtpNumHiddenLayers > 0 &&
//     _qwen35MTPEnabled`. The `qwen3_6_mtp` model_type alias exists only to route
//     the MERGED directory through the same factory entry the un-merged one
//     already reaches as `qwen3_5_text`. `verifyHeadConfiguration` asserts the
//     two config semantics the loader actually keys on, so a head tree whose
//     config drifted away from the backbone's family fails loudly.
//
//  4. PYTHON HAZARD, CARRIED FORWARD. mlx-lm's `qwen3_5` `sanitize()` treats any
//     `mtp.*` key as a signal to +1-shift every trunk norm weight, which corrupts
//     the model. That hazard belongs to Python consumers of a MERGED directory
//     (QWEN36-BOX3-MTP-RESPONSE.md §3.2); the Swift loader is unaffected, and this
//     path never writes a merged directory for anyone else to read. The note is
//     kept here because this is now the place the recipe lives.
