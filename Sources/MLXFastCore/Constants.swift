    // Qwen35*-prefixed. That name did not move across the 3.6 -> 3.8 change,
    // and neither did the tower geometry.
    //
    // REPINNED 2026-08-14 onto the ADOPTED 3.8 backbone. The cutover commit
    // (5bfae9c) deliberately left these five at their 3.6 values while the
    // ranked workflow's MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_CHECKPOINT_REPO / _REVISION read
    // QWEN38-PENDING-RELEASE, on the reasoning that a compiled-in PLACEHOLDER
    // would break a build that has to keep passing. That reasoning was about
    // placeholders, and it is spent: there is now a real artifact to name, so
    // the split between what the workflow pins and what the binary compiles
    // against is closed rather than widened.
    //
    // WHAT THAT COSTS, stated instead of discovered. `Golden.swift` validates
    // the provenance block of every golden against repository+revision, and the
    // CHECKED-IN public correctness goldens in correctness_prompts/ still carry
    // the 3.6 provenance, because they are 3.6 captures awaiting regeneration
    // under the 3.8 tokenizer (their workflow pins read QWEN38-PENDING-RELEASE
    // for the same reason). So those goldens are now REJECTED against these
    // constants. That is the fail-closed direction -- a 3.6 golden must not
    // validate against a 3.8 target -- but it is a real consequence: the local
    // public drift gate cannot pass until the goldens are regenerated, and it
    // should not.
    //
    // The other two consumers moved with these in the same commit: setup.sh
    // builds its Hugging Face download URL from the same pair, and the
    // BenchmarkScriptTests pin that asserts the two agree. Tests/Fixtures/
    // Qwen3627B4bit/ and fixtures/qwen3_6_27b_* keep their 3.6 names and 3.6
    // content deliberately -- they describe the checkpoint they were captured
    // from, and the geometry they record is now known to describe both towers.
    //
    // Provenance of the pin: EigenLabs/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit is OUR OWN MLX 4-bit
    // affine / group_size 64 conversion, produced under a pinned mlx 0.32.0
    // toolchain, of the official bf16 base Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B @
    // 1d4bf0f2ff6012fd82039f2fa52739d0dd7c60c0.
    //
    // IDENTITY SWAP, second decision of 2026-08-14. These constants briefly
    // named a third-party personal-account conversion of the same bf16 base.
    // That adoption was TERMINATED by the operator's validation kill-switch:
    // the deterministic reconversion cross-check it had reserved was performed,
    // and 994 of 1,847 tensors differ numerically from our own mlx-0.32.0
    // conversion. A reference whose bytes we cannot reproduce is not a
    // reference. The termination is recorded once, in the contract fixture's
    // target.upstream_source_note; this comment names only the replacement.
    //
    // THE REVISION IS A REAL SHA AGAIN, as of the backbone publish on
    // 2026-08-14. Between the identity swap and the upload it carried the
    // backbone-publish pending marker, deliberately: a marker fails the
    // pin-completeness gate by NAME, while a stale-but-real sha would have been
    // the dangerous option because it would RESOLVE, against somebody else's
    // commit. The upload landed, so that marker is retired here and at every
    // other site that spelled it, in one commit -- setup.sh's download URL, the
    // cache path below, the ranked and provisioning workflows' three spellings
    // of the snapshot directory, and the manifest fixture's Revision header.
    // Nothing about the fail-closed posture changed: the goldens are still 3.6
