// Both verbs share this one path. `mtp-timed` reports the parent's own wall
// clock over its own configured token total; `mtp-verify` runs the identical
// decode untimed and additionally retains the row ledger as evidence. Running
// them through the same code is deliberate: the retired Gemma track ran its two
// sides through different verbs, which put any divergence between the code paths
// straight into the score, and the DFlash track fixed that by moving the width
// instead. Here the depth moves, and the verbs differ only in what they report.
